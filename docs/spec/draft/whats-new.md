This document describes the major changes brought by this Working
Draft relative to the prior release, [v1.1].

## Summary of changes

-   Addition of the [Source Track](source-requirements) which helps
    organizations secure their source code development process and consumers
    establish trust in that source.
-   Updated the [threat model](threats) to account for the threats mitigated by
    the Source Track.
-   Improved the structure of the spec to accomodate multiple tracks.
-   Addition of SLSA [Verified Properties](verified-properties) that allows
    software supply chain controls that don't fit neatly within existing SLSA
    levels or that do exist within SLSA levels but where their is utility in
    recognizing the specific control while the software might not meet all the
    other requirements of that level.
