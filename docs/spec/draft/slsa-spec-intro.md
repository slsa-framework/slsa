# SLSA Specification Working Draft

SLSA is a specification for describing and incrementally improving supply chain security, established by industry consensus. It is organized into a series of levels that describe increasing security guarantees. 

## Table of Contents

This specification provides the standards and recommendations needed to implement the SLSA framework to mitigate supply chain threats. It consists of four different sections of information that cover key SLSA concept categories. These four sections of the Table of Contents contain coverage on the following topics:

## Introduction to SLSA
The topics in this section will familiarize users with the basic SLSA platform technology principles to help them get started. They cover:

### What is SLSA?

- Why SLSA is needed
- SLSA in layperson’s terms
- Who is SLSA for?
- How SLSA works
- What SLSA doesn’t cover

### About this specification

- Who are we?
- Licenses and sponsors
- What’s new?
- Future directions
- Specification stages
- Version history

### SLSA terminology

- General terminology
- Track-specific terminology (links)
- Terms to avoid
- SLSA terms mapped to real world terms

### Applying SLSA

- Use cases
- Guiding principles

## The Supply Chain Problem

The categories of security threats to the software supply chain are introduced and defined in detail on these two pages with diagrams, tables of real-world examples, and overviews of how SLSA can help: 

- Introduction to Supply Chain Attacks
- Threats & Mitigations

## The SLSA Solution

The SLSA framework can provide different levels of software security by implementing the requirements defined in this specification.  It includes four tracks of requirements that target different types of threats to the supply chain. They are briefly introduced and each of the four tracks provide standards and recommendations for addressing threat level issues related to:

  SLSA makes it possible for software security levels to be tested through the following SLSA automation attestation formats:
  
  - General model
  - Provenance
  - Build Provenance
