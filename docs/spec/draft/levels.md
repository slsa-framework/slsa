SLSA is organized into a series of levels and tracks that provide increasing
supply chain security guarantees on various aspects of the supply chain
security. This gives you confidence that software hasn’t been tampered with
and can be securely traced back to its source.

This page is a descriptive overview of the SLSA tracks and levels, describing
their intent. For the prescriptive requirements for each track and level, see
the individual track specifications. For a general overview of SLSA, see
[About SLSA](principles.md).

## Levels and tracks

SLSA levels are split into *tracks*. Each track has its own set of levels that
measure a particular aspect of supply chain security. The purpose of tracks is
to recognize progress made in one aspect of security without blocking on an
unrelated aspect. Tracks also allow the SLSA spec to evolve: we can add more
tracks without invalidating previous levels.

## Build track levels

| Track/Level | Requirements | Focus
| ----------- | ------------ | -----
| [Build L0]  | (none)       | (n/a)
| [Build L1]  | Provenance showing how the package was built | Mistakes, documentation
| [Build L2]  | Signed provenance, generated by a hosted build platform | Tampering after the build
| [Build L3]  | Hardened build platform | Tampering during the build

> Note: The [previous version] of the specification used a single unnamed track,
> SLSA 1–4. For version 1.0 the Source aspects were removed to focus on the
> Build track. A Source track may be added in [future versions].

For more information see the [Build track] specification.

## Source track levels

| Track/Level | Requirements | Focus
| ----------- | ------------ | -----
| [Source L0] | (none)       | (n/a)
| [Source L1] | Version controlled   | Change tracking
| [Source L2] | Branch history       | Tampering of source versioning
| [Source L3] | Authenticatable and Auditable Provenance       | Tampering within the SCS's storage systems.

For more information see the [Source track] specification.

## Build Environment track levels

| Track/Level   | Requirements | Focus | Trust Root
| ------------- | ------------ | ----- | ----------
| [BuildEnv L0] | (none)       | (n/a) | (n/a)
| [BuildEnv L1] | Signed build image provenance exists | Tampering during build image distribution | Signed build image provenance
| [BuildEnv L2] | Attested build environment instantiation | Tampering via the build platform's control plane | The compute platform's host interface
| [BuildEnv L3] | Hardware-attested build environment | Tampering via the compute platform's host interface | The compute platform's hardware

For more information see the [Build Environment track] specification.
