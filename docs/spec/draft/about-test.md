## Introduction to SLSA

### What is SLSA?

Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts, or SLSA ("salsa"), is a set of incrementally adoptable guidelines for supply chain security,
established by industry consensus. The specification set by SLSA is useful for
both software producers and consumers: producers can follow SLSA's guidelines to
make their software supply chain more secure, and consumers can use SLSA to make
decisions about whether to trust a software package.

SLSA offers:

-   A common vocabulary to talk about software supply chain security
-   A way to secure your incoming supply chain by evaluating the trustworthiness of the artifacts you consume
-   An actionable checklist to improve your own software's security
-   A way to measure your efforts toward compliance with the [Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf)

## Why SLSA is needed

High-profile attacks like those against [SolarWinds](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sunspot-malware-technical-analysis/) or [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/apr-2021-post-mortem/) have exposed the kind of supply
chain integrity weaknesses that may go unnoticed, yet quickly become very
public, disruptive, and costly in today's environment when exploited. They've
also shown that there are inherent risks not just in code itself, but at
multiple points in the complex process of getting that code into software
systems—that is, in the **software supply chain**. Since these attacks are on
the rise and show no sign of decreasing, a universal framework for hardening the
software supply chain is needed, as affirmed by the U.S. Executive Order on
Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity of May 12th, 2021.

Security techniques for vulnerability detection and analysis of source code are
essential, but are not enough on their own. Even after fuzzing or vulnerability
scanning is completed, changes to code can happen, whether unintentionally or
from ....
