## Q: Why is SLSA not transitive?

SLSA Build levels only cover the trustworthiness of a single build, with no
requirements about the build levels of transitive dependencies. The reason for
this is to make the problem tractable. If a SLSA Build level required
dependencies to be the same level, then reaching a level would require starting
at the very beginning of the supply chain and working forward. This is
backwards, forcing us to work on the least risky component first and blocking
any progress further downstream. By making each artifact's SLSA rating
independent from one another, it allows parallel progress and prioritization
based on risk. (This is a lesson we learned when deploying other security
controls at scale throughout Google.) We expect SLSA ratings to be composed to
describe a supply chain's overall security stance, as described in the case
study [vision](../../example.md#vision-case-study).

## Q: What about reproducible builds?

When talking about [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org), there
are two related but distinct concepts: "reproducible" and "verified
reproducible."

"Reproducible" means that repeating the build with the same inputs results in
bit-for-bit identical output. This property
[provides](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/buy-in/)
[many](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds/About)
[benefits](https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch14.html#hermeticcomma_reproduciblecomma_or_veri),
including easier debugging, more confident cherry-pick releases, better build
caching and storage efficiency, and accurate dependency tracking.

"Verified reproducible" means using two or more independent build platforms to
corroborate the provenance of a build. In this way, one can create an overall
platform that is more trustworthy than any of the individual components. This is
often
[suggested](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/blog/preventing-supply-chain-attacks-like-solarwinds/)
as a solution to supply chain integrity. Indeed, this is one option to secure
build steps of a supply chain. When designed correctly, such a platform can
satisfy all of the SLSA Build level requirements.

That said, verified reproducible builds are not a complete solution to supply
chain integrity, nor are they practical in all cases:

-   Reproducible builds do not address source, dependency, or distribution
    threats.
-   Reproducers must truly be independent, lest they all be susceptible to the
    same attack. For example, if all rebuilders run the same pipeline software,
    and that software has a vulnerability that can be triggered by sending a
    build request, then an attacker can compromise all rebuilders, violating the
    assumption above.
-   Some builds cannot easily be made reproducible, as noted above.
-   Closed-source reproducible builds require the code owner to either grant
    source access to multiple independent rebuilders, which is unacceptable in
    many cases, or develop multiple, independent in-house rebuilders, which is
    likely prohibitively expensive.

Therefore, SLSA does not require verified reproducible builds directly. Instead,
verified reproducible builds are one option for implementing the requirements.

## Q: How does SLSA relate to in-toto?

[in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) is a framework to secure software supply chains
hosted at the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/). The in-toto
specification provides a generalized workflow to secure different steps in a
software supply chain. The SLSA specification recommends
[in-toto attestations](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation) as the vehicle to
express Provenance and other attributes of software supply chains. Thus, in-toto
can be thought of as the unopinionated layer to express information pertaining
to a software supply chain, and SLSA as the opinionated layer specifying exactly
what information must be captured in in-toto metadata to achieve the guarantees
of a particular level.

in-toto's official implementations written in
[Go](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang),
[Java](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-java), and
[Rust](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-rs) include support for generating
SLSA Provenance metadata. These APIs are used in other tools generating SLSA
Provenance such as Sigstore's cosign, the SLSA GitHub Generator, and the in-toto
Jenkins plugin.

## Q. What is the difference between a build platform, system, and service?

Build platform and build system have been used interchangeably in the past. With
the v1.0 specification, however, there has been a unification around the term
platform as indicated in the [Terminology](terminology.md). The use of the word
`system` still exists related to software and services within the build platform
and to systems outside of a build platform like change management systems.

A build service is a hosted build platform that is often run on shared infrastructure
instead of individuals' machines and workstations. Its use has also been replaced outside
of the requirements as it relates to the build platform.

## Q: Is SLSA the same as TACOS?

No.
[Trusted Attestation and Compliance for Open Source (TACOS)](https://github.com/tacosframework)
is a framework authored by Tidelift.
Per their website, TACOS is a framework
"for assessing the development practices of open source projects
against a set of secure development standards specified by the (US)
NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) V1.1" which
"vendors can use to provide self-attestation for the open source components
they rely on."

In contrast, SLSA is a community-developed framework---including
adoptable guidelines for securing a software supply chain and
mechanism to evaluate the trustworthiness of artifacts you consume---that
is part of the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF).

## Q: How does SLSA and SLSA Provenance relate to SBOM?

[Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)] are a frequently recommended tool for
increased software supply chain rigor. An SBOM is typically focused on
understanding software in order to evaluate risk through known vulnerabilities
and license compliance. These use-cases require fine-grained and timely data
which can be refined to improve signal-to-noise ratio.

[SLSA Provenance] and the [Build track] are focused on trustworthiness of the
build process. To improve trustworthiness, Provenance is generated in the build
platform's trusted control plane, which in practice results in it being coarse
grained. For example, in Provenance metadata completeness of
`resolvedDependencies` information is on a best-effort basis. Further, the
`ResourceDescriptor` type does not require version and license information or
even a URI to the dependency's original location.

While they likely include similar data, SBOMs and SLSA Provenance operate at
different levels of abstraction. The fine-grained data in an SBOM typically
describes the components present in a produced artifact, whereas SLSA
Provenance more coarsely describes parameters of a build which are external to
the build platform.

The granularity and expressiveness of the two use-cases differs enough that
current SBOM formats were deemed not a good fit for the requirements of
the Build track. Yet SBOMs are a good practice and may form part of a future
SLSA Vulnerabilities track. Further, SLSA Provenance can increase the
trustworthiness of an SBOM by describing how the SBOM was created.

SLSA Provenance, the wider [in-toto Attestation Framework] in which the
recommended format sits, and the various SBOM standards, are all rapidly
evolving spaces. There is ongoing investigation into linking between the
different formats and exploration of alignment on common models. This FAQ entry
describes our understanding of the intersection efforts today. We do not know
how things will evolve over the coming months and years, but we look forward to
the collaboration and improved software supply chain security.

## Q: How to SLSA with a self-hosted runner

Some CI systems allow producers to provide their own self-hosted runners as a build
environment (e.g. [GitHub Actions]). While there are many valid reasons to leverage
these, classifying the SLSA build level for the resulting artifact can be confusing.

Since the SLSA Build track describes increasing levels of trustworthiness and
completeness in a package artifact's <dfn>provenance</dfn>, interpretation of the
specification hinges on the platform entities involved in the provenance generation.
The SLSA [build level requirements] (secure key storage, isolation, etc.) should be
imposed on the transitive closure of the systems which are responsible for informing
the provenance generated.

Some common situations may include:

-   The platform generates the provenance and just calls a runner for individual items.
    In this situation, the provenance is only affected by the platform so there would be
    no requirements imposed on the runner.
-   The runner generates the provenance. In this situation, the orchestrating platform
    is irrelevant and all requirements are imposed on the runner.
-   The platform provides the runner with some credentials for generating the provenance
    or both the platform and the runner provide information for the provenance. Trust is
    shared between the platform and the runner so the requirements are imposed on both.

Additional requirements on the self-hosted runners may be added to Build levels
greater than L3 when such levels get defined.
