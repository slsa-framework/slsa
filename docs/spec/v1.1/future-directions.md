The initial [draft version (v0.1)] of SLSA had a larger scope including
protections against tampering with source code and a higher level of build
integrity (Build L4). This page collects some early thoughts on how SLSA
**might** evolve in future versions to re-introduce those notions and add other
additional aspects of automatable supply chain security.

## Build track

### Build L4

A build L4 could include further hardening of the build platform and enabling
corraboration of the provenance, for example by providing complete knowledge of
the build inputs.

The initial [draft version (v0.1)] of SLSA defined a "SLSA 4" that included the
following requirements, which **may or may not** be part of a future Build L4:

-   Pinned dependencies, which guarantee that each build runs on exactly the
    same set of inputs.
-   Hermetic builds, which guarantee that no extraneous dependencies are used.
-   All dependencies listed in the provenance, which enables downstream verifiers
    to recursively apply SLSA to dependencies.
-   Reproducible builds, which enable other build platforms to corroborate the
    provenance.

## Source track

A Source track could provide protection against tampering of the source code
prior to the build.

The initial [draft version (v0.1)](../v0.1/requirements.md#source-requirements)
of SLSA included the following source requirements, which **may or may not**
form the basis for a future Source track:

-   Strong authentication of author and reviewer identities, such as 2-factor
    authentication using a hardware security key, to resist account and
    credential compromise.
-   Retention of the source code to allow for after-the-fact inspection and
    future rebuilds.
-   Mandatory two-person review of all changes to the source to prevent a single
    compromised actor or account from introducing malicious changes.

## Build Platform Operations track

A Build Platform Operations track could provide assurances around the hardening
of build platforms as they are operated.

The initial [draft version (v0.1)] of SLSA included a section on
[common requirements](../v0.1/requirements.md#common-requirements) that formed
the foundation of the guidance for
[verifying build systems](verifying-systems.md), which **may or may not** form
the basis for a future Build Platform Operations track:

-   Controls for approval, logging, and auditing of all physical and remote
    access to platform infrastructure, cryptographic secrets, and privileged
    debugging interfaces.
-   Conformance to security best practices to minimize the risk of compromise.
-   Protection of cryptographic secrets used by the build platform.
