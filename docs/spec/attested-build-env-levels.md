title: Build Environment track
description: This page gives an overview of the SLSA Build Environment track and its levels, describing their security objectives and general requirements.
---

## Rationale

Today's hosted [build platforms] play a central role in an artifact's supply
chain. Whether it's a cloud-hosted service like GitHub Actions or an internal
enterprise CI/CD system, the build platform has a privileged level of access
to artifacts and sensitive operations during a build (e.g., access to
producer secrets, provenance signing).

This central and privileged role makes hosted build platforms an attractive
target for supply chain attackers. But even with strong economic and
reputational incentives to mitigate these risks, it's very challenging to
implement and operate fully secure build platforms because they are made up
of many layers of interconnected components and subsystems.

The SLSA Build Environment track aims to address these issues by making it
possible to validate the integrity and trace the [provenance] of core build
platform components.

## Track overview

The SLSA Build Environment (BuildEnv) track describes increasing levels of
integrity and trustworthiness of the provenance of a build's
execution context. In this track, provenance describes how a build image
was created, how the hosted build platform deployed a build image in its
environment, and the compute platform they used.

| Track/Level   | Requirements | Focus | Trust Root
| ------------- | ------------ | ----- | ----------
| [BuildEnv L0] | (none)       | (n/a) | (n/a)
| [BuildEnv L1] | Signed build image provenance exists | Tampering during build image distribution | Signed build image provenance
| [BuildEnv L2] | Attested build environment instantiation | Tampering via the build platform's control plane | The compute platform's host interface
| [BuildEnv L3] | Hardware-attested build environment | Tampering via the compute platform's host interface | The compute platform's hardware

> :warning:
> The Build Environment track L1+ currently requires a [hosted] build platform.
> A future version of this track may generalize requirements to cover bare-metal
> build environments.

> :grey_exclamation:
> We may consider the addition of an L4 to the Build Environment track, which
> covers hardware-attested runtime integrity checking during a build.

### Build environment model

<p align="center"><img src="images/build-env-model.svg" alt="Build Environment Model"></p>

The Build Environment (BuildEnv) track expands upon the
[build model](terminology#build-model) by explicitly separating the
[build image](terminology#build-image) and [compute platform](#compute-platform) from the
abstract [build environment](#build-environment) and [build platform](terminology#platform).
Specifically, the BuildEnv track defines the following roles, components, and concepts:

| Primary Term | Description
| --- | ---
| <span id="build-id">Build ID</span> | An immutable identifier assigned uniquely to a specific execution of a tenant's build. In practice, the build ID may be an identifier, such as a UUID, associated with the build execution.
| <span id="build-image">Build image</span> | The template for a build environment, such as a VM or container image. Individual components of a build image include the root filesystem, pre-installed guest OS and packages, the build executor, and the build agent.
| <span id="build-image-producer">Build image producer</span> | The party that creates and distributes build images. In practice, the build image producer may be the hosted build platform or a third party in a bring-your-own (BYO) build image setting.
| <span id="build-agent">Build agent</span> | A build platform-provided program that interfaces with the build platform's control plane from within a running build environment. The build agent is also responsible for executing the tenantâ€™s build definition, i.e., running the build. In practice, the build agent may be loaded into the build environment after instantiation, and may consist of multiple components. All build agent components must be measured along with the build image.
| <span id="build-dispatch">Build dispatch</span> | The process of assigning a tenant's build to a pre-deployed build environment on a hosted build platform.
| <span id="compute-platform">Compute platform</span> | The compute system and infrastructure underlying a build platform, i.e., the host system (hypervisor and/or OS) and hardware. In practice, the compute platform and the build platform may be managed by the same or distinct organizations.
| <span id="host-interface">Host interface</span> | The component in the compute platform that the hosted build platform uses to request resources for deploying new build environments, i.e., the VMM/hypervisor or container orchestrator.
| <span id="boot-process">Boot process</span> | In the context of builds, the process of loading and executing the layers of firmware and/or software needed to start up a build environment on the host compute platform.
| <span id="measurement">Measurement</span> | The cryptographic hash of some component or system state in the build environment, including software binaries, configuration, or initialized run-time data.
| <span id="quote">Quote</span> | (Virtual) hardware-signed data that contains one or more (virtual) hardware-generated measurements. Quotes may additionally include nonces for replay protection, firmware information, or other platform metadata. (Based on the definition in [section 9.5.3.1](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2.0-1.83-Part-1-Architecture.pdf) of the TPM 2.0 spec)
| <span id="reference-value">Reference value</span> | A specific measurement used as the good known value for a given build environment component or state.

**TODO:** Disambiguate similar terms (e.g., image, build job, build executor/runner)

#### Build environment lifecycle

A typical build environment will go through the following lifecycle:

1.  *Build image creation*: A [build image producer](#build-image-producer)
    creates different [build images](#build-image) through a dedicated build
 process. For the SLSA BuildEnv track, the build image producer outputs
 [provenance](terminology#provenance) describing this process.
2.  *Build environment instantiation*: The [hosted build platform](terminology#platform)
    calls into the [host interface](#host-interface) to create a new instance
 of a build environment from a given build image. The
 [build agent](#build-agent) begins to wait for an incoming
 [build dispatch](#build-dispatch).
 For the SLSA BuildEnv track, the host interface in the compute platform
 attests to the integrity of the environment's initial state during its
 [boot process](#boot-process).
3.  *Build dispatch*: When the tenant dispatches a new build, the hosted
    build platform assigns the build to a created build environment.
    For the SLSA BuildEnv track, the build platform attests to the binding
 between a build environment and [build ID](#build-id).
4.  *Build execution*: Finally, the build agent within the environment executes
    the tenant's build definition.

### Build environment threats

TODO

## BuildEnv levels

The primary purpose of the Build Environment (BuildEnv) track is to enable
auditing that a build was run in the expected [execution context].

The lowest level only requires SLSA [Build L2] Provenance to
exist for the [build image], while higher levels provide increasing
auditability of the build environment's properties and integrity of the
generated provenance attestations. The highest levels introduce further
requirements for hardware-assisted hardening of the [compute platform]
aimed at reducing the trusted computing base of a build.

Software producers and third-party auditors can check attestations generated
by the [build image producer] and build platform against the expected
properties for a given build environment. This enables any party to detect
[several classes] of supply chain threats originating in the build
environment.

As in the Build track, the exact implementation of this track is determined
by the build platform implementer, whether they are a commercial CI/CD service
or enterprise organization. While this track describes general minimum
requirements, this track does not dictate the following
implementation-specific details: the type of build environment, accepted
attestation formats, the type of technologies used to meet L3 requirements,
how attestations are distributed, how build environments are identified, and
what happens on failure.

    -   Build images MUST be created via a SLSA [Build L3] or higher build
    process.

    SLSA Provenance, or [SCAI]).
    Additional build image components whose initial state is to be checked
    MAY be also measured.
    -   The build agent MUST be capable of:
        -   Upon completion of the [boot process]: Automatically interfacing
        with the host interface to obtain and transmit a signed quote for the
        build environment's system state.
        -   Upon build dispatch: Automatically generating and distributing
        a signed attestation that binds its boot process quote to the

-   Build Platform Requirements:
    -   MUST meet SLSA [Build L3] requirements.
    -   Prior to dispatching a tenant's build to an instantiated environment,
    a signed [quote] MUST be automatically requested from the build agent,
    and the contained [measurements] verified against their boot process
    reference values. A signed attestation to the result of the verification
    MUST be generated and distributed (e.g., via a [VSA]).

-   Compute Platform Requirements:
    -   The [host interface] MUST be capable of generating signed quotes for

    In a VM-based environment, this MUST be achieved by enabling a feature
    like [vTPM], or equivalent, in the hypervisor.
    For container-based environments, the container orchestrator MAY need
    modifications to produce these attestations.
    -   The host interface MUST validate the measurements of the build image
    components against their signed references values during the build
    environment's boot process.
    In a VM-based environment, this MUST be achieved by enabling a process
    like [Secure Boot], or equivalent, in the hypervisor.
    For container-based environments, the container orchestrator MAY need
    modifications to perform these checks.[^1]
    -   Prior to instantiating a new build environment, the host interface
    MUST automatically verify the SLSA Provenance for the selected build

    automatically verified against their reference values.
    A signed attestation to the result of the verification MUST be generated
    and distributed (e.g., via a [VSA]).

-   Compute Platform Requirements:
