<div class="subtitle">

This page covers the detailed technical requirements for each SLSA level. The
intended audience is system implementers and security engineers.

</div>

For an informative description of the levels intended for all audiences, see
[Levels](levels.md). For background, see [Terminology](terminology.md). To
better understand the reasoning behind the requirements, see [Threats and
mitigations](threats.md).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## TODO

**TODO:** Use consistent terminology throughout the site: "publish" vs
"release", "publisher" vs "maintainer" vs "developer", "consumer" vs
"ecosystem" vs "downstream system", "build" vs "produce.

**TODO:** Generate permalinks to sections.

## Overview

### Security Best Practices

While the exact definition of what constitutes a secure system is beyond the
scope of this specification, to be conformant all implementations MUST use
industry security best practices. This includes, but is not limited to, using
proper access controls, securing communications, implementing proper management
of cryptographic secrets, doing frequent updates, and promptly fixing known
vulnerabilities.

Various relevant standards and guides can be consulted for that matter such as
the [CIS Critical Security
Controls](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list).

## Producer

[Producer]: #producer

A package's <dfn>producer</dfn> is the organization that owns and releases the
software. It might be an open-source project, a company, a team within a
company, or even an individual.

The producer is responsible for setting expectations on how the package ought to
be built and then using that process on every release. How to set expectations
and what build systems are acceptable is determined by the [package ecosystem]
and/or [consumer]. Higher SLSA Build levels can be reached by choosing a build
system that supports that level.

The process differs whether or not the path to SLSA is
through reproducible builds.

> **TODO:** Reorganize to match the [Overview](#overview) table, i.e. "define
> expectations" and "Use an acceptable builds and release process". There might
> also need to be a first "decide on a build system" step?

### Without reproducible builds

Up front:

-   Decide on a build system, which affects the maximum level that can be
    reached. Ideally this would be a system that already supports Build L3 or
    plans to do so in an acceptable time frame.
-   Define how the package is expected to be built, if needed by the package
    ecosystem. For example, this might require setting the upstream source
    repository in the package metadata.
-   Configure the build to reach the desired level, if needed by the build
    system. For example, a project built on GitHub Actions might use the
    [GitHub Actions Provenance Generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator).
-   Configure the release process to upload provenance generated by the build
    system, if needed by the package ecosystem. For example, a packaging
    tool might require an additional command-line flag to during upload.

Every release:

-   Use the expected build and release process. For example, this might mean
    releasing on a CI/CD platform instead of a maintainer's workstation.

### With reproducible builds

If the package ecosystem supports verified [reproducible
builds](https://reproducible-builds.org), the producer continues building
mostly as they have always done, with no specific requirements other than
generating sufficient provenance. Independent "rebuilders" will reproduce the
build after-the-fact to corroborate the trustworthiness of the provenance.

Every release:

-   Use the build and release process provided by the package ecosystem, which
    generates provenance in an acceptable format.
-   Ensure that the build is deterministic and that all dependencies are
    properly declared. Otherwise rebuilders will not be able to reproduce the
    package.

## Build system

[Build system]: #build-system

A package's <dfn>build system</dfn> is the infrastructure used to transform the
software from source to package. This includes the transitive closure of all
hardware, software, persons, and organizations that can influence the build. A
build system is often a hosted, multi-tenant build service, but it could be a
system of multiple independent rebuilders, a special-purpose build system used
by a single software project, or even a developer's workstation. Ideally, one
build system is used by many different software packages so that consumers can
[minimize the number of trusted systems](principles.md). For more background,
see [Build Model](terminology.md#build-model).

The build system is responsible for providing two things: [provenance
generation] and [isolation between builds]. The [Build level](levels.md#build-track) describes
the degree to which each of these properties is met.

> **TODO:** Pick better degree names. "Hosted", "Fully isolated", etc are not
> obvious.

### Provenance generation

[Provenance generation]: #provenance-generation

The build system is responsible for generating provenance describing how the
package was produced.

The SLSA Build level describes the minimum bound for:

-   *Completeness:* What information is contained in the provenance?
-   *Authenticity:* How strongly can the provenance be tied back to the builder?
-   *Accuracy:* How resistant is the provenance generation to tampering within
    the build process?

<table>
<tr><th>Requirement<th>Description<th>L1<th>L2<th>L3

<tr id="provenance-exists"><td>Provenance Exists<td>

The build process MUST generate provenance that unambiguously identifies the
output package and describes how that package was produced.

The format MUST be acceptable to the [package ecosystem] and/or [consumer]. It
is RECOMMENDED to use the [SLSA Provenance] format and [associated suite]
because it is designed to be interoperable, universal, and unambiguous when
used for SLSA. See that format's documentation for requirements and
implementation guidelines. If using an alternate format, it MUST contain the
equivalent information as SLSA Provenance at each level and SHOULD be
bi-directionally translatable to SLSA Provenance.

-   *Completeness:* Best effort. The provenance at L1 SHOULD contain sufficient
    information to catch mistakes and simulate the user experience at higher
    levels in the absence of tampering. In other words, the contents of the
    provenance SHOULD be the same at all Build levels, but a few fields MAY be
    absent at L1 if they are prohibitively expensive to implement.
-   *Authenticity:* No requirements.
-   *Accuracy:* No requirements.

[SLSA Provenance]: ../../provenance/v1/index
[associated suite]: ../../attestation-model#recommended-suite

<td>✓<td>✓<td>✓
<tr id="provenance-authentic"><td>Provenance Authentic<td>

*Authenticity:* Consumers MUST be able to validate the authenticity of the
provenance attestation in order to:

-   *Ensure integrity:* Verify that the digital signature of the provenance
    attestation is valid and the provenance was not tampered with after the
    build.
-   *Define trust:* The provenance attestation identifies the build system or
    other entities that are necessary to trust in order to trust the artifact
    they produced.

This SHOULD be through a digital signature from a private key
accessible only to the service which generated the provenance attestation.

This allows the consumer to trust the contents of the provenance attestation,
such as the identity of the build system.

Note: This requirement was called "non-falsifiable" in the initial
[draft version (v0.1)](../v0.1/requirements.md#non-falsifiable).

*Accuracy:* The provenance MUST be generated by the build system (i.e. within
the trust boundary identified in the provenance) and not by a tenant of the
build system (i.e. outside the trust boundary).

-   The data in the provenance MUST be obtained from the build service, either
    because the generator *is* the build service or because the provenance
    generator reads the data directly from the build service.
-   The build system MUST have some security control to prevent tenants from
    tampering with the provenance. However, there is no minimum bound on the
    strength. The purpose is to deter adversaries who might face legal or
    financial risk from evading controls.

*Completeness:* SHOULD be complete, but there MAY be external parameters that
are not sufficiently captured in the provenance.

**TODO:** Provide guidance on PKI, e.g. make the public key available to
verifiers.

<td> <td>✓<td>✓
<tr id="provenance-non-forgeable"><td>Provenance Non-forgeable<td>

*Accuracy:* Provenance MUST be strongly resistant to influence by tenants.

-   Any secret material used to demonstrate the non-forgeable nature of
    the provenance, for example the signing key used to generate a digital
    signature, MUST be stored in a secure management system appropriate for
    such material and accessible only to the build service account.
-   Such secret material MUST NOT be accessible to the environment running
    the user-defined build steps.
-   Every field in the provenance MUST be generated or verified by the build
    service in a trusted control plane. The user-controlled build steps MUST
    NOT be able to inject or alter the contents.

*Completeness:* MUST be complete. In particular, the external parameters MUST be
fully enumerated in the provenance.

<td> <td> <td>✓
</table>

### Isolation strength

[Isolation strength]: #isolation-strength
[Isolation between builds]: #isolation-strength

The build system is responsible for isolating between builds, even within the
same tenant project. In other words, how strong of a guarantee do we have that
the build really executed correctly, without external influence?

The SLSA Build level describes the minimum bar for isolation strength. For more
information on assessing a build system's isolation strength, see
[Verifying build systems](verifying-systems.md).

<table>
<tr><th>Requirement<th>Description<th>L1<th>L2<th>L3

<tr id="build-service">
<td>Build service
<td>

All build steps ran using some build service, not on a maintainer's
workstation.

Examples: GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build, Travis CI.

<td> <td>✓<td>✓
<tr id="ephemeral-isolated">
<td>Ephemeral and isolated
<td>

The build service ensured that the build steps ran in an ephemeral and isolated
environment provisioned solely for this build, free of influence from other
build instances, whether prior or concurrent.

-   It MUST NOT be possible for a build to access any secrets of the build service, such as the provenance signing key.
-   It MUST NOT be possible for two builds that overlap in time to influence one another.
-   It MUST NOT be possible for one build to persist or influence the build environment of a subsequent build.
-   Build caches, if used, MUST be purely content-addressable to prevent tampering.
-   The build SHOULD NOT call out to remote execution unless it's considered part of the "builder" within the trust boundary.
-   The build SHOULD NOT open services that allow for remote influence.

Note: This requirement was split into "Isolated" and "Ephemeral Environment" the
initial [draft version (v0.1)](../v0.1/requirements.md).

<td> <td> <td>✓
</table>

### Possible future requirements

The initial [draft version (v0.1)](../v0.1/requirements.md) of SLSA defined a
"SLSA 4" that included the following requirements. A future Build L4 might
incorporate some or all of the following, in whole or in part. This list is not
exhaustive.

> WARNING: The draft requirements here are unversioned and subject to change.

<details id="parameterless">
<summary>Parameterless (draft)</summary>

The build output cannot be affected by user parameters other than the build
entry point and the top-level source location. In other words, the build is
fully defined through the build script and nothing else.

Examples:

-   GitHub Actions
    [workflow_dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch)
    `inputs` MUST be empty.
-   Google Cloud Build
    [user-defined substitutions](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values)
    MUST be empty. (Default substitutions, whose values are defined by the
    server, are acceptable.)

</details>
<details id="hermetic">
<summary>Hermetic (draft)</summary>

All transitive build steps, sources, and dependencies were fully declared up
front with *immutable references*, and the build steps ran with no network
access.

An **immutable reference** is an identifier that is
guaranteed to always point to the same, immutable artifact. This MUST allow the
consumer to locate the artifact and SHOULD include a cryptographic hash of the
artifact's contents to ensure integrity. Examples: git URL + branch/tag/ref \+
commit ID; cloud storage bucket ID + SHA-256 hash; Subversion URL (no hash).

The user-defined build script:

-   MUST declare all dependencies, including sources and other build steps,
    using *immutable references* in a format that the build service understands.

The build service:

-   MUST fetch all artifacts in a trusted control plane.
-   MUST NOT allow mutable references.
-   MUST verify the integrity of each artifact.
    -   If the *immutable reference* includes a cryptographic hash, the service
        MUST verify the hash and reject the fetch if the verification fails.
    -   Otherwise, the service MUST fetch the artifact over a channel that
        ensures transport integrity, such as TLS or code signing.
-   MUST prevent network access while running the build steps.
    -   This requirement is "best effort." It SHOULD deter a reasonable team
        from having a non-hermetic build, but it need not stop a determined
        adversary. For example, using a container to prevent network access is
        sufficient.

</details>
<details id="reproducible">
<summary>Reproducible (draft)</summary>

Re-running the build steps with identical input artifacts results in bit-for-bit
identical output. Builds that cannot meet this MUST provide a justification why
the build cannot be made reproducible.

"○" means that this requirement is "best effort". The user-provided build script
SHOULD declare whether the build is intended to be reproducible or a
justification why not. The build service MAY blindly propagate this intent
without verifying reproducibility. A consumer MAY reject the build if it does
not reproduce.

</details>
<details id="dependencies-complete">
<summary>Dependencies complete (draft)</summary>

Provenance records all build dependencies that were available while running the
build steps. This includes the initial state of the machine, VM, or container of
the build worker.

-   MUST include all user-specified build steps, sources, dependencies.
-   SHOULD include all service-provided artifacts.

</details>

## Package ecosystem

[Package ecosystem]: #package-ecosystem

> **TODO:** Is there a better term that is more obvious to most readers?

A <dfn>package ecosystem</dfn> is a set of conventions and tooling for package
distribution. Every package has an ecosystem, whether it is formal or ad-hoc.
Some ecosystems are formal, such as language distribution (e.g.
[Python/PyPA](https://www.pypa.io)), operating system distribution (e.g.
[Debian/Apt](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format)), or artifact
distribution (e.g. [OCI](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec)).
Other ecosystems are informal, such as a convention used within a company. Even
ad-hoc distribution of software, such as through a link on a website, is
considered an "ecosystem".

The package ecosystem is responsible for ensuring that consumers only use
artifacts ...**TODO**

**TODO:** Provenance MUST be available to the package ecosystem and/or
consumers. For the build system, this usually means outputting the provenance as
part of the build to allow the release process to upload it in a manner
prescribed by the package ecosystem.

### Setting Expectations

<dfn>Expectations</dfn> define the allowed values for
[`buildType`](/provenance/v1/#buildType) and
[`externalParameters`](/provenance/v1/#externalParameters)
for a given package (assuming the SLSA provenance format) in order to address
the [build integrity threats](threats#build-integrity-threats).
> **TODO:** link to more concrete guidance once it's available.

It is important to note that expectations are tied to a *package name*, whereas
provenance is tied to an *artifact*. Package ecosystem's using the
[RECOMMENDED suite](/attestation-model#recommended-suite) of attestation
formats SHOULD list the package name in the provenance attestation statement's
`subject` field, though the precise semantics for binding a package name to an
artifact are defined by the package ecosystem.

<table>
<tr><th>Requirement<th>Description<th>L1<th>L2<th>L3

<tr id="expectations-known">
<td>Expectations known
<td>

The package ecosystem MUST ensure that expectations are defined for the package before it is made available to package ecosystem users.

There are several approaches a package ecosystem could take to setting expectations, for example:

-   Requiring the producer to set expectations when registering a new package
    in the package ecosystem.
-   Using the values from the package's provenance during its initial
    publication (trust on first use).

<td>✓<td>✓<td>✓
<tr id="expectations-changes-auth">
<td>Changes authorized
<td>

The package ecosystem MUST ensure that any changes to expectations are
authorized by the package's producer. This is to prevent a malicious actor
from updating the expectations to allow building and publishing from a fork
under the actor's control. Some ways this could be achieved include:

-   Requiring two authorized individuals from the package producer to approve
    the change.
-   Requiring consumers to approve changes, in a similar fashion to how SSH
    host fingerprint changes have to be approved by users.
-   Disallowing changes altogether, for example by binding the package name to
    the source repository.

<td><td>✓<td>✓
</table>

### Verifying expectations for artifacts

It is a critical responsibility of the package ecosystem to verify that the
provenance for a package matches the expectations defined for that package.

A package version is considered to meet a given SLSA level if and only if the
package ecosystem has verified its provenance against the package's
expectations. If expectations are defined for a package but no provenance
exists for the artifact, this MUST result in verification failure.
Conversely, if multiple provenance attestations exist, the system SHOULD accept
any combination that satisifes expectations.

Verifying expectations could happen in multiple places within a package
ecosystem, for example by using one or more of the following approaches:

-   During package upload, the registry ensures that the package's provenance
    matches the known expectations for that package before accepting it into
    the registry.
-   During client-side installation/deployment of a package, the package
    ecosystem client ensures that the package's provenance matches the
    known expectations for that package before use.
-   Package ecosystem participants and/or the ecosystem operators perform
    continuous monitoring of packages to detect any changes to packages which
    do not match the known expectations. **TODO:** do we need to
    emphasize that the value of monitoring without enforcement is lower?

All package ecosystem verifiers will require a mapping from builder identity to
the SLSA level the builder is trusted to meet. How this map is defined,
distributed, and updated is package ecosystem specific.
> **TODO:** expand on this map model. Provide examples for ecosystems to follow,
perhaps in the use-cases, and link to certification.

Verification MUST include the following steps:

-   Ensuring that the builder identity is one of those in the map of trusted
    builder id's to SLSA level.
-   [Verification of the provenance](/provenance/v1/#verification) metadata.
-   Ensuring that the values for `BuildType` and `ExternalParameters` in the
    provenance match the known expectations. The package ecosystem MAY allow
    an approved list of `ExternalParameters` to be ignored during verification.
    Any unrecognized `ExternalParameters` SHOULD cause verification to fail.

NOTE: The term *package ecosystem* MAY be interpreted loosely. For example, one
could implement a system which is external to the canonical package ecosystem
and perform SLSA verification for that package ecosystem's contents. This
combination can be considered a package ecosystem for the purposes of setting
and verifying expectations.

**TODO:** Update the requirements to provide guidelines for how to implement,
showing what the options are:

-   Create a more concrete guide on how to do expectations
-   Whether provenance is generated during the initial build and/or
    after-the-fact using reproducible builds
-   How provenance is distributed
-   What happens on failure: blocking, warning, and/or asynchronous notification

## Consumer

[Consumer]: #consumer

A package's <dfn>consumer</dfn> is the organization or individual that uses the
package.

The consumer MAY have to opt-in to enable SLSA verification, depending on the
package ecosystem.

The consumer MUST ensure that artifacts they consume are built on
SLSA-conformant build systems. Consumers MUST either audit the build systems
themselves using the prompts in [verifying systems](verifying-systems.md) or
rely on the [SLSA certification program](certification.md).

> **TODO:** Anything else? Do they need to make risk-based decisions? Respond to
> errors/warnings? Do consumers trust builders, or is that up to the package ecosystem?

## Source control

[Source control]: #source-control

A package's <dfn>source control system</dfn> is the infrastructure for managing
versions of the package's source code.

There are currently no requirements for the source control system because the
SLSA [Source track](levels.md#source-track) is not yet defined. The initial
[draft version (v0.1)](../v0.1/requirements.md#source-requirements) of SLSA
included the following source requirements, which might form the basis for a
future Source track. Each entry might or might not be included in the future, in
whole or in part. The list is not exhaustive.

> WARNING: The draft requirements here are unversioned and subject to change.

<details id="version-controlled">
<summary>Version controlled (draft)</summary>

Every change to the source is tracked in a version control system that meets the
following requirements:

-   **[Change history]** There exists a record of the history of changes
    that went into the revision. Each change MUST contain: the identities of
    the uploader and reviewers (if any), timestamps of the reviews (if any)
    and submission, the change description/justification, the content of
    the change, and the parent revisions.

-   **\[Immutable reference]** There exists a way to indefinitely reference
    this particular, immutable revision. In git, this is the {repo URL +
    branch/tag/ref + commit ID}.

Most popular version control system meet this requirement, such as git,
Mercurial, Subversion, or Perforce.

NOTE: This does NOT require that the code, uploader/reviewer identities, or
change history be made public. Rather, some organization attests to the fact
that these requirements are met, and it is up to the consumer whether this
attestation is sufficient.

"○" = RECOMMENDED.

</details>
<details id="verified-history">
<summary>Verified history (draft)</summary>

Every change in the revision's history has at least one strongly authenticated
actor identity (author, uploader, reviewer, etc.) and timestamp. It MUST be
clear which identities were verified, and those identities MUST use [two-step
verification](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/) or similar. (Exceptions
noted below.)

-   **[First-parent history]** In the case of a non-linear version control
    system, where a revision can have more than one parent, only the "first
    parent history" is in scope. In other words, when a feature branch is merged
    back into the main branch, only the merge itself is in scope.
-   **[Historical cutoff]** There is some TBD exception to allow existing
    projects to meet SLSA 3/4 even if historical revisions were present in the
    history. Current thinking is that this could be either last N months or a
    platform attestation guaranteeing that future changes in the next N months
    will meet the requirements.

"Strongly authenticated" means that the actor was mapped to a specific person
using an authentication mechanism which is resistant to account and credential
compromise. For example, 2-factor authentication (2FA) where one factor is a
hardware security key (i.e. YubiKey).

</details>
<details id="retained-indefinitely">
<summary>Retained indefinitely (draft)</summary>

The revision and its change history are preserved indefinitely and cannot be
deleted, except when subject to an established and transparent policy for
obliteration, such as a legal or policy requirement.

-   **[Immutable history]** It MUST not be possible for persons to delete or
    modify the history, even with multi-party approval, except by trusted
    platform admins with two-party approval following the obliterate policy.
-   **[Limited retention for SLSA 3]** At SLSA 3 (but not 4), it is acceptable
    for the retention to be limited to 18 months, as attested by the source
    control platform.
    -   Example: If a commit is made on 2020-04-05 and then a retention
        attestation is generated on 2021-01-01, the commit MUST be retained
        until at least 2022-07-01.

</details>
<details id="two-person-reviewed">
<summary>Two-person reviewed (draft)</summary>

Every change in the revision's history was agreed to by two trusted persons
prior to submission, and both of these trusted persons were strongly
authenticated. (Exceptions from [Verified History](#verified-history) apply here
as well.)

-   The following combinations are acceptable:
    -   Uploader and reviewer are two different trusted persons.
    -   Two different reviewers are trusted persons.
-   **[Different persons]** The platform ensures that no person can use
  alternate identities to bypass the two-person review requirement.
    -   Example: if a person uploads with identity X then reviews with alias Y,
        the platform understands that this is the same person and does not
        consider the review requirement satisfied.
-   **[Informed review]** The reviewer is able and encouraged to make an
    informed decision about what they're approving. The reviewer SHOULD be
    presented with a full, meaningful content diff between the proposed revision
    and the previously reviewed revision. For example, it is not sufficient to
    just indicate that file changed without showing the contents.
-   **[Context-specific approvals]** Approvals are for a specific context, such
    as a repo + branch in git. Moving fully reviewed content from one context to
    another still requires review. (Exact definition of "context" depends on the
    project, and this does not preclude well-understood automatic or reviewless
    merges, such as cutting a release branch.)
    -   Git example: If a fully reviewed commit in one repo is merged into a
        different repo, or a commit in one branch is merged into a different
        branch, then the merge still requires review.

"Trusted persons" are the set of persons who are granted the authority to
maintain a software project. For example, https://github.com/MarkLodato/dotfiles
has just one trusted person (MarkLodato), while
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central has a set of trusted persons with write
access to the mozilla-central repository.
