What follows is a comprehensive technical analysis of supply chain threats and
their corresponding mitigations in SLSA. For an introduction to the
supply chain threats that SLSA protects agains, see [Supply chain threats].

The examples on this page are meant to:

-   Explain the reasons for each of the SLSA [requirements](requirements.md).
-   Increase confidence that the SLSA requirements are sufficient to achieve the
    desired [level](levels.md) of integrity protection.
-   Help implementers better understand what they are protecting against so that
    they can better design and implement controls.

## Source integrity threats

A source integrity threat is a potential for an adversary to introduce a change
to the source code that does not reflect the intent of the software producer.
This includes the threat of an authorized individual introducing an unauthorized
change---in other words, an insider threat.

SLSA v1.0 does not address source integrity, though we anticipate a [Source
track](future-directions.md#source-track) might do so in a future version. In
the meantime, the threats and potential mitigations listed here show how SLSA
v1.0 can fit into a broader supply chain security program.

### (A) Submit unauthorized change

An adversary introduces a change through the official source control management
interface without any special administrator privileges.

#### (A1) Submit change without review

<details><summary>Directly submit without review</summary>

*Threat:* Submit bad code to the source repository without another person
reviewing.

*Mitigation:* Source repository requires two-person approval for all changes.

*Example:* Adversary directly pushes a change to a GitHub repo's `main` branch.
Solution: Configure GitHub's "branch protection" feature to require pull request
reviews on the `main` branch.

</details>
<details><summary>Review own change through a sock puppet account</summary>

*Threat:* Propose a change using one account and then approve it using another
account.

*Mitigation:* Source repository requires approval from two different, trusted
persons. If the proposer is trusted, only one approval is needed; otherwise two
approvals are needed. The software producer maps accounts to trusted persons.

*Example:* Adversary creates a pull request using a secondary account and then
approves and merges the pull request using their primary account. Solution:
Configure branch protection to require two approvals and ensure that all
repository contributors and owners map to unique persons.

</details>
<details><summary>Use a robot account to submit change</summary>

*Threat:* Exploit a robot account that has the ability to submit changes without
two-person review.

*Mitigation:* All changes require two-person review, even changes authored by
robots.

*Example:* A file within the source repository is automatically generated by a
robot, which is allowed to submit without review. Adversary compromises the
robot and submits a malicious change without review. Solution: Require human
review for these changes.

> RFC ([#196](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/issues/196)): This solution
> may not be practical. Should there be an exception for locked down robot
> accounts?

</details>
<details><summary>Abuse review exceptions</summary>

*Threat:* Exploit a review exception to submit a bad change without review.

*Mitigation:* All changes require two-person review without exception.

*Example:* Source repository requires two-person review on all changes except
for "documentation changes," defined as only touching files ending with `.md` or
`.html`. Adversary submits a malicious executable named `evil.md` without review
using this exception, and then builds a malicious package containing this
executable. This would pass expectations because the source repository is
correct, and the source repository does require two-person review. Solution: Do
not allow such exceptions.

> RFC: This solution may not be practical in all circumstances. Are there any
> valid exceptions? If so, how do we ensure they cannot be exploited?

</details>

#### (A2) Evade code review requirements

<details><summary>Modify code after review</summary>

*Threat:* Modify the code after it has been reviewed but before submission.

*Mitigation:* Source control platform invalidates approvals whenever the
proposed change is modified.

*Example:* Source repository requires two-person review on all changes.
Adversary sends a "good" pull request to a peer, who approves it. Adversary then
modifies it to contain "bad" code before submitting. Solution: Configure branch
protection to dismiss stale approvals when new changes are pushed.

> RFC: How do we handle the productivity hit? The cost of code review is already
> high for most projects, given current code review tooling, so making code
> review even costlier might not be considered warranted. Are there alternative
> solutions? Better tooling? Another SLSA level to represent this?

</details>
<details><summary>Submit a change that is unreviewable</summary>

*Threat:* Send a change that is meaningless for a human to review that looks
benign but is actually malicious.

*Mitigation:* Code review system ensures that all reviews are informed and
meaningful.

*Example:* A proposed change updates a file, but the reviewer is only presented
with a diff of the cryptographic hash, not of the file contents. Thus, the
reviewer does not have enough context to provide a meaningful review. Solution:
the code review system should present the reviewer with a content diff or some
other information to make an informed decision.

</details>
<details><summary>Copy a reviewed change to another context</summary>

*Threat:* Get a change reviewed in one context and then transfer it to a
different context.

*Mitigation:* Approvals are context-specific.

*Example:* MyPackage's source repository requires two-person review. Adversary
forks the repo, submits a change in the fork with review from a colluding
colleague (who is not trusted by MyPackage), then merges the change back into
the upstream repo. Solution: The merge should still require review, even though
the fork was reviewed.

</details>
<details><summary>Compromise another account</summary>

*Threat:* Compromise one or more trusted accounts and use those to submit and
review own changes.

*Mitigation:* Source control platform verifies two-factor authentication, which
increases the difficulty of compromising accounts.

*Example:* Trusted person uses a weak password on GitHub. Adversary guesses the
weak password, logs in, and pushes changes to a GitHub repo. Solution: Configure
GitHub organization to requires 2FA for all trusted persons. This would increase
the difficulty of using the compromised password to log in to GitHub.

</details>
<details><summary>Hide bad change behind good one</summary>

*Threat:* Request review for a series of two commits, X and Y, where X is bad
and Y is good. Reviewer thinks they are approving only the final Y state whereas
they are also implicitly approving X.

*Mitigation:* Only the version that is actually reviewed is the one that is
approved. Any intermediate revisions don't count as being reviewed.

*Example:* Adversary sends a pull request containing malicious commit X and
benign commit Y that undoes X. In the pull request UI, reviewer only reviews and
approves "changes from all commits", which is a delta from HEAD to Y; they don't
see X. Adversary then builds from the malicious revision X. Solution:
Expectations do not accept this because the version X is not considered
reviewed.

</details>

#### (A3) Code review bypasses that are out of scope of SLSA

<details><summary>Software producer intentionally submits bad code</summary>

*Threat:* Software producer intentionally submits "bad" code, following all
proper processes.

*Mitigation:* **Outside the scope of SLSA.** Trust of the software producer is
an important but separate property from integrity.

*Example:* A popular extension producer sells the rights to a new owner, who then
modifies the code to secretly mine bitcoin at the users' expense. SLSA does not
protect against this, though if the extension were open source, regular auditing
may discourage this from happening.

</details>
<details><summary>Collude with another trusted person</summary>

*Threat:* Two trusted persons collude to author and approve a bad change.

*Mitigation:* **Outside the scope of SLSA.** We use "two trusted persons" as a
proxy for "intent of the software producer".

</details>
<details><summary>Trick reviewer into approving bad code</summary>

*Threat:* Construct a change that looks benign but is actually malicious, a.k.a.
"bugdoor."

*Mitigation:* **Outside the scope of SLSA.**

</details>
<details><summary>Reviewer blindly approves changes</summary>

*Threat:* Reviewer approves changes without actually reviewing, a.k.a. "rubber
stamping."

*Mitigation:* **Outside the scope of SLSA.**

</details>

### (B) Compromise source repo

An adversary introduces a change to the source control repository through an
administrative interface, or through a compromise of the underlying
infrastructure.

<details><summary>Project owner bypasses or disables controls</summary>

*Threat:* Trusted person with "admin" privileges in a repository submits "bad"
code bypassing existing controls.

*Mitigation:* All persons are subject to same controls, whether or not they have
administrator privileges. Disabling the controls requires two-person review (and
maybe notifies other trusted persons?)

*Example 1:* GitHub project owner pushes a change without review, even though
GitHub branch protection is enabled. Solution: Enable the "Include
Administrators" option for the branch protection.

*Example 2:* GitHub project owner disables "Include Administrators", pushes a
change without review, then re-enables "Include Administrators". This currently
has no solution on GitHub.

</details>
<details><summary>Platform admin abuses privileges</summary>

*Threat:* Platform administrator abuses their privileges to bypass controls or
to push a malicious version of the software.

*Mitigation:* TBD

*Example 1:* GitHostingService employee uses an internal tool to push changes to
the MyPackage source repo.

*Example 2:* GitHostingService employee uses an internal tool to push a
malicious version of the server to serve malicious versions of MyPackage sources
to a specific CI/CD client but the regular version to everyone else, in order to
hide tracks.

*Example 3:* GitHostingService employee uses an internal tool to push a
malicious version of the server that includes a backdoor allowing specific users
to bypass branch protections. Adversary then uses this backdoor to submit a
change to MyPackage without review.

</details>
<details><summary>Exploit vulnerability in SCM</summary>

*Threat:* Exploit a vulnerability in the implementation of the source code
management system to bypass controls.

*Mitigation:* **Outside the scope of SLSA.**

</details>

## Build integrity threats

A build integrity threat is a potential for an adversary to introduce behavior
to a package that is not reflected in the source code, or to build from a
source, dependency, and/or process that is not intended by the software
producer.

The SLSA Build track covers these threats when combined with verifying artifacts
against expectations.

### (C) Build from modified source

An adversary builds from a version of the source code that does not match the
official source control repository.

The mitigation here is to compare the provenance against expectations for the
package, which depends on SLSA Build L1 for provenance. (Threats against the
provenance itself are covered by (E) and (F).)

<details><summary>Build from unofficial fork of code <span>(expectations)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Build using the expected CI/CD process but from an unofficial fork of
the code that may contain unauthorized changes.

*Mitigation:* Verifier requires the provenance's source location to match an
expected value.

*Example:* MyPackage is supposed to be built from GitHub repo `good/my-package`.
Instead, it is built from `evilfork/my-package`. Solution: Verifier rejects
because the source location does not match.

</details>
<details><summary>Build from unofficial branch or tag <span>(expectations)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Build using the expected CI/CD process and source location, but
checking out an "experimental" branch or similar that may contain code not
intended for release.

*Mitigation:* Verifier requires that the provenance's source branch/tag matches
an expected value, or that the source revision is reachable from an expected
branch.

*Example:* MyPackage's releases are tagged from the `main` branch, which has
branch protections. Adversary builds from the unprotected `experimental` branch
containing unofficial changes. Solution: Verifier rejects because the source
revision is not reachable from `main`.

</details>
<details><summary>Build from unofficial build steps <span>(expectations)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Build the package using the proper CI/CD platform but with unofficial
build steps.

*Mitigation:* Verifier requires that the provenance's build configuration source
matches an expected value.

*Example:* MyPackage is expected to be built by Google Cloud Build using the
build steps defined in the source's `cloudbuild.yaml` file. Adversary builds
with Google Cloud Build, but using custom build steps provided over RPC.
Solution: Verifier rejects because the build steps did not come from the
expected source.

</details>
<details><summary>Build from unofficial parameters <span>(expectations)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Build using the expected CI/CD process, source location, and
branch/tag, but using a parameter that injects unofficial behavior.

*Mitigation:* Verifier requires that the provenance's external parameters all
match expected values.

*Example 1:* MyPackage is supposed to be built from the `release.yml` workflow.
Adversary builds from the `debug.yml` workflow. Solution: Verifier rejects
because the workflow parameter does not match the expected value.

*Example 2:* MyPackage's GitHub Actions Workflow uses `github.event.inputs` to
allow users to specify custom compiler flags per invocation. Adversary sets a
compiler flag that overrides a macro to inject malicious behavior into the
output binary. Solution: Verifier rejects because the `inputs` parameter was not
expected.

</details>
<details><summary>Build from modified version of code modified after checkout <span>(expectations)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Build from a version of the code that includes modifications after
checkout.

*Mitigation:* Build service pulls directly from the source repository and
accurately records the source location in provenance.

*Example:* Adversary fetches from MyPackage's source repo, makes a local commit,
then requests a build from that local commit. Builder records the fact that it
did not pull from the official source repo. Solution: Verifier rejects because
the source repo does not match the expected value.

</details>

### (D) Use compromised dependency

> **TODO:** What exactly is this about? Is it about compromising the build
> process through a bad build tool, and/or is it about compromising the output
> package through a bad library? Does it involve all upstream threats to the
> dependency, or is it just about this particular use of the package (e.g.
> tampering on input, or choosing a bad dependency)?

<!-- separate TODO -->

> **TODO:** Fill this out to give more examples of threats from compromised
> dependencies.

### (E) Compromise build process

An adversary introduces an unauthorized change to a build output through
tampering of the build process; or introduces false information into the
provenance.

These threats are directly addressed by the SLSA Build track.

<details><summary>Compromise other build <span>(Build L3)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Perform a "bad" build that alters the behavior of another "good" build
running in parallel or subsequent environments.

*Mitigation:* Builds are [isolated] from one another, with no way for one to
affect the other or persist changes.

*Example 1:* Build service runs all builds for project MyPackage on
the same machine as the same Linux user. Adversary starts a "bad" build that
listens for the "good" build and swaps out source files, then starts a "good"
build that would otherwise pass expectations. Solution: Builder changes
architecture to isolate each build in a separate VM or similar.

*Example 2:* Build service uses the same machine for subsequent
builds. Adversary first runs a build that replaces the `make` binary with a
malicious version, then runs a subsequent build that otherwise would pass
expectations. Solution: Builder changes architecture to start each build with a
clean machine image.

</details>
<details><summary>Steal cryptographic secrets <span>(Build L3)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Use or exfiltrate the provenance signing key or some other
cryptographic secret that should only be available to the build service.

*Mitigation:* Builds are [isolated] from the trusted build service control
plane, and only the control plane has [access][non-forgeable] to cryptographic
secrets.

*Example:* Provence is signed on the build worker, which the adversary has
control over. Adversary uses a malicious process that generates false provenance
and signs it using the provenance signing key. Solution: Builder generates and
signs provenance in the trusted control plane; the worker has no access to the
key.

</details>
<details><summary>Set values of the provenance <span>(Build L2-L3)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Generate false provenance and get the trusted control plane to sign
it.

*Mitigation:* At Build L2+, trusted control plane [generates][authentic] all
information that goes in the provenance, except (optionally) the output artifact
hash. At Build L3+, this is [hardened][non-forgeable] to prevent compromise even
by determined adversaries.

*Example 1 (Build L2):* Provenance is generated on the build worker, which the
adversary has control over. Adversary uses a malicious process to get the build
service to claim that it was built from source repo `good/my-package` when it
was really built from `evil/my-package`. Solution: Builder generates and signs
the provenance in the trusted control plane; the worker reports the output
artifacts but otherwise has no influence over the provenance.

*Example 2 (Build L3):* Provenance is generated in the trusted control plane,
but workers can break out of the container to access the signing material.
Solution: Builder is hardened to provide strong isolation against tenant
projects.

</details>
<details><summary>Poison the build cache <span>(Build L3)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Add a "bad" artifact to a build cache that is later picked up by a
"good" build process.

*Mitigation:* Build caches must be [isolate][isolated] between builds to prevent
such cache poisoning attacks.

*Example:* Build system uses a build cache across builds, keyed by the hash of
the source file. Adversary runs a malicious build that creates a "poisoned"
cache entry with a falsified key, meaning that the value wasn't really produced
from that source. A subsequent build then picks up that poisoned cache entry.

</details>
<details><summary>Project owner <span>(TBD)</span></summary>

**TODO:** similar to Source (do the same threats apply here?)

</details>
<details><summary>Platform admin <span>(TBD)</span></summary>

**TODO:** similar to Source

</details>

### (F) Upload modified package

An adversary uploads a package not built from the proper build process.

<details><summary>Build with untrusted CI/CD <span>(expectations)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Build using an unofficial CI/CD pipeline that does not build in the
correct way.

*Mitigation:* Verifier requires provenance showing that the builder matched an
expected value.

*Example:* MyPackage is expected to be built on Google Cloud Build, which is
trusted up to Build L3. Adversary builds on SomeOtherBuildService, which is only
trusted up to Build L2, and then exploits SomeOtherBuildService to inject bad
behavior. Solution: Verifier rejects because builder is not as expected.

</details>
<details><summary>Upload package without provenance <span>(Build L1)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Upload a package without provenance.

*Mitigation:* Verifier requires provenance before accepting the package.

*Example:* Adversary uploads a malicious version of MyPackage to the package
repository without provenance. Solution: Verifier rejects because provenance is
missing.

</details>
<details><summary>Tamper with artifact after CI/CD <span>(Build L1)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Take a good version of the package, modify it in some way, then
re-upload it using the original provenance.

*Mitigation:* Verifier checks that the provenance's `subject` matches the hash
of the package.

*Example:* Adversary performs a proper build, modifies the artifact, then
uploads the modified version of the package to the repository along with the
provenance. Solution: Verifier rejects because the hash of the artifact does not
match the `subject` found within the provenance.

</details>
<details><summary>Tamper with provenance <span>(Build L2)</span></summary>

*Threat:* Perform a build that would not pass expectations, then modify the
provenance to make the expectations checks pass.

*Mitigation:* Verifier only accepts provenance with a valid [cryptographic
signature][authentic] or equivalent proving that the provenance came from an
acceptable builder.

*Example:* MyPackage is expected to be built by GitHub Actions from the
`good/my-package` repo. Adversary builds with GitHub Actions from the
`evil/my-package` repo and then modifies the provenance so that the source looks
like it came from `good/my-package`. Solution: Verifier rejects because the
cryptographic signature is no longer valid.

</details>

### (G) Compromise package repo

An adversary modifies the package on the package repository using an
administrative interface or through a compromise of the infrastructure.

**TODO:** fill this out

### (H) Use compromised package

An adversary modifies the package after it has left the package repository, or
tricks the user into using an unintended package.

<details><summary>Typosquatting</summary>

*Threat:* Register a package name that is similar looking to a popular package
and get users to use your malicious package instead of the benign one.

*Mitigation:* **Mostly outside the scope of SLSA.** That said, the requirement
to make the source available can be a mild deterrent, can aid investigation or
ad-hoc analysis, and can complement source-based typosquatting solutions.

</details>

## Availability threats

An availability threat is a potential for an adversary to deny someone from
reading a source and its associated change history, or from building a package.

SLSA v1.0 does not address availability threats, though future versions might.

<details><summary>(A)(B) Delete the code</summary>

*Threat:* Perform a build from a particular source revision and then delete that
revision or cause it to get garbage collected, preventing anyone from inspecting
the code.

*Mitigation:* Some system retains the revision and its version control history,
making it available for inspection indefinitely. Users cannot delete the
revision except as part of a transparent legal or privacy process.

*Example:* Adversary submits bad code to the MyPackage GitHub repo, builds from
that revision, then does a force push to erase that revision from history (or
requests GitHub to delete the repo.) This would make the revision unavailable
for inspection. Solution: Verifier rejects the package because it lacks a
positive attestation showing that some system, such as GitHub, ensured retention
and availability of the source code.

</details>
<details><summary>(D) A dependency becomes temporarily or permanently unavailable to the build process</summary>

*Threat:* Unable to perform a build with the intended dependencies.

*Mitigation:* **Outside the scope of SLSA.** That said, some solutions to
support hermetic and reproducible builds may also reduce the impact of this
threat.

</details>

## Other threats

Threats that can compromise the ability to prevent or detect the supply chain
security threats above but that do not fall cleanly into any one category.

<details><summary>Tamper with expectations</summary>

*Threat:* Modify the expectations to accept something that would not otherwise
be accepted.

*Mitigation:* Changes to expectations require some form of authorization, such
as two-party review.

*Example:* Expectations for MyPackage only allows source repo `good/my-package`.
Adversary modifies the expectations to also accept `evil/my-package`, then
builds from that repo and uploads a bad version of the package. Solution:
Expectation changes require two-party review.

</details>
<details><summary>Forge change metadata</summary>

*Threat:* Forge the change metadata to alter attribution, timestamp, or
discoverability of a change.

*Mitigation:* Source control platform strongly authenticates actor identity,
timestamp, and parent revisions.

*Example:* Adversary submits a git commit with a falsified author and timestamp,
and then rewrites history with a non-fast-forward update to make it appear to
have been made long ago. Solution: Consumer detects this by seeing that such
changes are not strongly authenticated and thus not trustworthy.

</details>
<details><summary>Exploit cryptographic hash collisions</summary>

*Threat:* Exploit a cryptographic hash collision weakness to bypass one of the
other controls.

*Mitigation:* Require cryptographically secure hash functions for code review
and provenance, such as SHA-256.

*Examples:* Construct a "good" file and a "bad" file with the same SHA-1 hash.
Get the "good" file reviewed and then submit the "bad" file, or get the "good"
file reviewed and submitted and then build from the "bad" file. Solution: Only
accept cryptographic hashes with strong collision resistance.
