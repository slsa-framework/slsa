SLSA is organized into a series of levels that provide increasing supply chain
security guarantees. This gives you confidence that software hasn’t been
tampered with and can be securely traced back to its source.

This page is a descriptive overview of the SLSA levels and tracks, describing
their intent. For the prescriptive requirements for each level, see
[Requirements](requirements.md). For a general overview of SLSA, see
[About SLSA](principles.md).

## Levels and tracks

SLSA levels are split into *tracks*. Each track has its own set of levels that
measure a particular aspect of supply chain security. The purpose of tracks is
to recognize progress made in one aspect of security without blocking on an
unrelated aspect. Tracks also allow the SLSA spec to evolve: we can add more
tracks without invalidating previous levels.

| Track/Level | Requirements | Focus
| ----------- | ------------ | -----
| [Build L0]  | (none)       | (n/a)
| [Build L1]  | Provenance showing how the package was built | Mistakes, documentation
| [Build L2]  | Signed provenance, generated by a hosted build service | Tampering after the build
| [Build L3]  | Hardened build service | Tampering during the build

<!-- For comparison: a future Build L4's focus might be reproducibility or
hermeticity or completeness of provenance -->

> Note: The [previous version] of the specification used a single unnamed track,
> SLSA 1–4. For version 1.0 the Source aspects were removed to focus on the
> Build track. A Source track may be added in [future versions].

## Build track

The SLSA build track describes increasing levels of trustworthiness and
completeness in a package artifact's <dfn>provenance</dfn>. Provenance describes
what entity built the artifact, what process they used, and what the inputs
were. The lowest level only requires the provenance to exist, while higher
levels provide increasing protection against tampering of the build, the
provenance, or the artifact.

The primary purpose of the build track is to enable [verification] that the
artifact was built as expected. Consumers have some way of knowing what the
expected provenance should look like for a given package and then compare each
package artifact's actual provenance to those expectations. Doing so prevents
several classes of [supply chain threats](threats.md).

Each ecosystem (for open source) or organization (for closed source) defines
exactly how this is implemented, including: means of defining expectations, what
provenance format is accepted, whether reproducible builds are used, how
provenance is distributed, when verification happens, and what happens on
failure. Guidelines for implementers can be found in the
[requirements](requirements.md).

<section id="build-l0">

### Build L0: No guarantees

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

No requirements---L0 represents the lack of SLSA.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Development or test builds of software that are built and run on the same
machine, such as unit tests.

<dt>Requirements<dd>

n/a

<dt>Benefits<dd>

n/a

</dl>
</section>
<section id="build-l1">

### Build L1: Provenance exists

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

Package has provenance showing how it was built. Can be used to prevent mistakes
but is trivial to bypass or forge.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Projects and organizations wanting to easily and quickly gain some benefits of
SLSA---other than tamper protection---without changing their build workflows.

<dt>Requirements<dd>

-   Software producer follows a consistent build process so that others can form
    expectations about what a "correct" build looks like.

-   Build system automatically generates [provenance] describing how the
    artifact was built, including: what entity built the package, what build
    process they used, and what the top-level input to the build were.

-   Software producer distributes provenance to consumers, preferably using a
    convention determined by the package ecosystem.

<dt>Benefits<dd>

-   Makes it easier for both producers and consumers to debug, patch, rebuild,
    and/or analyze the software by knowing its precise source version and build
    process.

-   With [verification], prevents mistakes during the release process, such as
    building from a commit that is not present in the upstream repo.

-   Aids organizations in creating an inventory of software and build systems
    used across a variety of teams.

<dt>Notes<dd>

-   Provenance may be incomplete and/or unsigned at L1. Higher levels require
    more complete and trustworthy provenance.

</dl>

<section id="build-l2">

### Build L2: Build service

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

Forging the provenance or evading verification requires an explicit "attack",
though this may be easy to perform. Deters unsophisticated adversaries or those
who face legal or financial risk.

In practice, this means that builds run on a hosted service that generates and
signs[^sign] the provenance.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Projects and organizations wanting to gain moderate security benefits of SLSA by
switching to a hosted build service, while waiting for changes to the build
service itself required by [Build L3].

<dt>Requirements<dd>

All of [Build L1], plus:

-   The build runs on a hosted build service that generates and signs[^sign] the
    provenance itself. This may be the original build, an after-the-fact
    reproducible build, or some equivalent system that ensures the
    trustworthiness of the provenance.

-   Downstream verification of provenance includes validating the authenticity
    of the provenance.

<dt>Benefits<dd>

All of [Build L1], plus:

-   Prevents tampering after the build through digital signatures[^sign].

-   Deters adversaries who face legal or financial risk by evading security
    controls, such as employees who face risk of getting fired.

-   Reduces attack surface by limiting builds to specific build services that
    can be audited and hardened.

-   Allows large-scale migration of teams to supported build services early
    while further hardening work ([Build L3]) is done in parallel.

</dl>
</section>
<section id="build-l3">

[^sign]: Alternate means of verifying the authenticity of the provenance are
    also acceptable.

### Build L3: Hardened builds

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

Forging the provenance or evading verification requires exploiting a
vulnerability that is beyond the capabilities of most adversaries.

In practice, this means that builds run on a hardened build service that offers
strong tamper protection.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Most software releases. Build L3 usually requires significant changes to
existing build services.

<dt>Requirements<dd>

All of [Build L2], plus:

-   Build service implements strong controls to:

    -   prevent runs from influencing one another, even within the same project.
    -   prevent secret material used to sign the provenance from being
        accessible to the user-defined build steps.

<dt>Benefits<dd>

All of [Build L2], plus:

-   Prevents tampering during the build---by insider threats, compromised
    credentials, or other tenants.

-   Greatly reduces the impact of compromised package upload credentials by
    requiring attacker to perform a difficult exploit of the build process.

-   Provides strong confidence that the package was built from the official
    source and build process.
