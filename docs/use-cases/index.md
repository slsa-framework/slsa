For a [full example](../example.md) that explores edge cases in greater detail, we created a use case for using curl through its official docker image.

[Want to contribute?](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/tree/main/case-studies) These are only a few of the most common use cases for developers, software consumers and repository maintainers. We welcome any real life scenarios you’ve faced using SLSA in your projects.
