Since the release of <a href="spec/v1.0/">SLSA v1.0</a> in 2023,
the SLSA community has been hard at work to expand the breadth
and depth of the specification with updates and new tracks.

Learn how you can [get involved](/community#get-involved)!

### Source track

A Source track will provide protection against tampering of the source code
prior to the build.

The current [draft version](/spec/draft/source-requirements.md) describes levels
of increasing tamper resistance and ways consumers might verify properties
of source revisions using SLSA source provenance attestations.

### Build Environment track

The goal of a Build Environment track is to enable the detection of tampering
with core components of the compute environment executing builds.

The current [draft version](/spec/draft/attested-build-env-levels.md)
of the Build Environment track includes the following requirements:

-   Generation and verification of SLSA Build Provenance for build images.
-   Validation of initial build environment system state against known good
    reference values.
-   Deployment of the hosted build platform on a compute system that supports
    system state measurement and attestation capabilities at the hardware level.

These requirements are **subject to significant change** while this track
is in draft.

### Dependency track

The Dependency track defines requirements aimed at mitigating risks introduced to a project through its dependencies.

There is an ongoing effort to develop this track, building upon the foundation laid by [S2C2F](https://openssf.org/projects/s2c2f/).
S2C2F provides a guide for the safe consumption of open source dependencies.

As part of this ongoing effort, community members from both SLSA and S2C2F are collaborating to translate the practices outlined in S2C2F, into requirements that align with the structure of existing SLSA specifications.
