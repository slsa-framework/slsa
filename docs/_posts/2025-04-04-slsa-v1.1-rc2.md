Today we’re releasing the [SLSA Version 1.1 RC2](/spec/v1.1-rc2/) for public review. 
We are seeking comments on these spec changes by April 18, 2025.
This release brings several changes aimed at enhancing the clarity and 
usability of the original specification. It also introduces backwards-compatible 
clarifications to the SLSA threat model, attestation model and verification 
procedure. This includes the addition of verifier metadata to the VSA format. 
Please, refer to the [What's new](/spec/v1.1-rc2/whats-new) section for further details.

What does this update mean for SLSA implimentors? Good news! This means that 
SLSA 1.1 is backwards compatible with SLSA 1.0. 

Although this is a relatively minor update, the SLSA working group has also 
been busy developing several new tracks covering areas such as source and 
build environment. We had originally hoped to release these 1.1 improvements 
as part of larger update but in the end we felt that the 1.1 release was warranted. 

So what’s next? The SLSA specification follows the [Community Specification] lifecycle 
going through several [stages of maturation](/spec-stages). The publication of a 
candidate for [Approved Specification] starts a 2 week review period during which 
the community at large is invited to review the draft and raise any issues. If 
you do find any issue, please, open an issue on [GitHub]. If no major issues are 
found during this review period the V1.1 RC2 draft will then be published as 
Version 1.1, the new [Approved Specification], effectively replacing Version 1.0.
