We’re excited to announce [SLSA v1.0 Release Candidate 2 (RC2)][RC2] following
the valuable feedback we received on the [first release candidate][RC1]. This is
intended to be the final release candidate before marking v1.0 as an [Approved
Specification].

We ask that all community members review the full specification and raise any
significant concerns as a [GitHub issue] **by April 17, 2023**. While we always
appreciate clarity or editorial feedback, during this review period we are
specifically looking to identify significant problems that would require a
breaking change---and thus a new version---to address. (We plan to continue to
addressing clarity issues via editorial changes after the v1.0 release,
particularly the [backlog] of editorial feedback from RC1 that we have not yet
addressed.)

Assuming there are no significant objections, we plan to mark this candidate as
an Approved Specification on April 19.

We appreciate the continued support and engagement from the SLSA community and
all early adopters who have provided valuable feedback on the previous release
candidate. Thank you for your contributions to the project!
