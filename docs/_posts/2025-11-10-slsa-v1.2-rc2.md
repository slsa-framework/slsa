Today we’re releasing for public review [SLSA Version 1.2
RC2](/spec/v1.2-rc2/), a Release Candidate of SLSA v1.2. We are seeking
comments on this specification by November 24th, 2025. It addresses most of the
[feedback] we received on [RC1].

With the introduction of the _Source Track_, SLSA v1.2 represents a major
milestone in the development of SLSA. Indeed, while SLSA v1.0 introduced
the notion of tracks with different levels focusing on different aspects of
the software supply chain, its scope was limited to the _Build Track_, a
narrower scope than what SLSA v0.1 covered. The _Source Track_ picks up the
source management related requirements that v0.1 touched on but in a much
more complete and thorough way, comparable to what was done in the _Build
Track_.

Please, refer to the [What's new](/spec/v1.2-rc2/whats-new) section for
further details.

SLSA v1.2 is backwards compatible with SLSA v1.1.

The SLSA specification follows the [Community Specification] lifecycle
going through several [stages of maturation](/spec-stages). The publication
of a candidate for [Approved Specification] starts a 2 week review period
during which the community at large is invited to review the draft and
raise any issues. If you do find any issue, please, open an issue on
[GitHub]. If no major issues are found during this review period the v1.2
RC2 draft will then be published as Version 1.2, the new [Approved
Specification], effectively replacing Version 1.1. Otherwise a v1.2 RC2
will be published instead.
