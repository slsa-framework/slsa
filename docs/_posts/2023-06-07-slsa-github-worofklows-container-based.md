Following the recent [launch of SLSA v1.0](https://openssf.org/press-release/2023/04/19/openssf-announces-slsa-version-1-0-release/), we’re announcing a new, [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/tree/main/internal/builders/docker) that achieves SLSA Build Track Level 3 for provenance generation. This lets users generate [unforgeable provenance](/spec/v1.0/requirements#provenance-unforgeable), allowing consumers to trust _and_ verify how their software artifacts were built. The container-based SLSA 3 builder is the result of a collaboration between the Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST), the SLSA community, and [Project Oak](https://github.com/project-oak/oak).

# **How it works**

The new container-based SLSA 3 builder runs a containerised build in a secure environment and generates an unforgeable provenance statement of the execution, all in an ecosystem-agnostic way that’s easy to add to your GitHub CI.

To ensure unforgeability of provenance, the container-based SLSA 3 builder uses the same secure build mechanisms used in other SLSA builders and generators, relying on GitHub reusable workflows and ephemeral VM containers for isolation. For more details, see the [technical design document](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/SPECIFICATIONS.md). As before, we rely on OpenID Connect (OIDC) with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) tooling to prove the identity of the workflow. These provide the workflow identity guarantees described in [an earlier blog post](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/04/improving-software-supply-chain.html) that announced the generic SLSA 3 generator.

The builder allows a developer to run a custom command in [a container](https://opencontainers.org/) in a secure environment, which gives the developer full control of the environment and customization of the container’s function. For example, the developer may choose to use the command to build a binary artifact, or produce metadata like [OpenSSF’s Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/) reports.

## **Enhanced provenance verification with the new workflow**

The container-based SLSA 3 builder differs from earlier builders and generators in the content of the generated provenance statements, and therefore how they can be verified. Like all provenance generated by all SLSA 3 builders and generators, you can trace the binary to its source code and verify the builder’s identity---and now, you can additionally perform detailed verification of the build process.

For instance, the provenance produced by the generic [SLSA 3 provenance generator minimally contains](/_posts/2022-08-29-slsa-github-workflows-generic-ga) the source GitHub repository and a reference to the workflow file that built the artifact. This workflow may contain any operation, ranging from copying a pre-built binary from another resource to running a massive build script. Because the provenance does not include these details, verifiers need to audit the referenced workflow file to establish trust in the build process.

The container-based SLSA 3 builder simplifies and enhances provenance verification by including the build process directly inside the provenance. This is enabled by a Docker-based build tool used internally in the container-based SLSA 3 builder for building the binaries and the new SLSA v1.0 provenance format. In particular, it includes the builder image and command directly inside the build definition:

```json
"buildDefinition":{
  "buildType":"https://slsa.dev/container-based-build/v0.1?draft",
  "externalParameters":{
    "source":{
      "uri":"git+https://github.com/slsa-framework/example-package@v0.1",
      "digest":{
        "sha1":"ca220e54c07b6fcdd758184a12c132ee3ae531f1"
      }
    },
    "builderImage":{
      "uri":"rust@sha256:74ad9d14ec89bc4e83bf2a3d007fd981513ee4b44279b40d3a90c001a6ca938c",
      "digest":{
        "sha256":"74ad9d14ec89bc4e83bf2a3d007fd981513ee4b44279b40d3a90c001a6ca938c"
      }
    },
    "configPath":".github/configs-docker/release-config.toml",
    "buildConfig":{
      "ArtifactPath":"target/release/my-rust-app",
      "Command":[
        "cargo", "build", "--release"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

# **Next Steps**

If your builds are already containerized, we encourage you to give the container-based SLSA 3 builder a try---see the step-by-step guide in our [onboarding tutorial.](https://github.com/project-oak/hello-transparent-release/blob/main/README.md) Otherwise, we suggest containerizing your build, which also improves the [reproducibility](https://reproducible-builds.org/) of your binaries, and adopting the container-based SLSA 3 builder.

Once you have generated a SLSA provenance with the container-based SLSA 3 builder, the next step to complete the lifecycle is to provide instructions to [verify the artifacts](/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts), including using the [slsa-verifier](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier) to verify the provenance. If you are using these artifacts in your own build pipeline, consider threat modeling your software supply chain and [building expectations](/spec/v1.0/verifying-artifacts#forming-expectations) for your build origins and process.

Please share your success stories with us by creating a pull request to add your project to [the list of container-based SLSA 3 users](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/internal/builders/docker/README.md#users). Feel free to create issues on the [repository](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) if you have noticed any issues, or are missing features you need. We look forward to fulfilling new requests and accepting new contributors to create even more useful features going forward.
