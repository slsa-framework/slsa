# SLSA: Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts

Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA, pronounced
_[salsa](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+pronounce+salsa)_) is an
end-to-end framework for ensuring the integrity of software artifacts throughout
the software supply chain. The requirements are inspired by Google’s internal
"[Binary Authorization for Borg]" that has been in use for the past 8+ years and
that is mandatory for all of Google's production workloads.

**IMPORTANT:** SLSA is an evolving specification and we are looking for
wide-ranging feedback via GitHub issues, [email][mailing list], or
[feedback form]. SLSA is being developed as part of the
[OpenSSF Digital Identity WG](https://github.com/ossf/wg-digital-identity-attestation).

## Overview

SLSA consists of:

1.  **[Standards][spec/README.md]:** Industry consensus on the definition of a
    "secure" software supply chain. There may be multiple standards to represent
    multiple aspects of security.
2.  **Accreditation:** Process for organizations to certify compliance with
    these standards.
3.  **[Technical controls](controls/README.md):** To record provenance and
    detect or prevent non-compliance.

Ultimately, the software consumer decides whom to trust and what standards to
enforce. In this light, accreditation is a means to transfer trust across
organizational boundaries. For example, a company may internally "accredit" its
in-house source and build systems while relying on OpenSSF to accredit
third-party ones. Other organizations may trust other accreditation bodies.

For more background and motivation, see [Background](background.md) and
[FAQ](faq.md).

## Principles

SLSA focuses on the following two main principles:

*   **Non-unilateral:** No person can modify the software artifact anywhere in
    the software supply chain without explicit review and approval by at least
    one other "trusted person."[^1] The purpose is prevention, deterrence,
    and/or early detection of risky/bad changes.

*   **Auditable:** The software artifact can be securely and transparently
    traced back to the original, human readable sources and dependencies. The
    primary purpose is for automated analyses of sources and dependencies, as
    well as ad-hoc investigations.

Though not perfect, these two principles provide substantial mitigation for a
wide range of tampering, confusion, and other supply chain attacks.

To measure how well protected a supply chain is according to the two principles
above, we propose the SLSA levels. A higher level means it is better protected.
SLSA 3 is the end goal but may take many years and significant investment for
large organizations. SLSA 1 and SLSA 2 are stepping stones to recognize
meaningful progress.

What sets SLSA 3 apart from simple best practices is its resilience against
determined adversaries. That is, SLSA is a **guarantee** that these practices
have been followed, though still not a guarantee that the software is "safe."

## Why do we need SLSA?

SLSA addresses three issues:

*   Software producers want to secure their supply chains but don't know exactly
    how.
*   Software consumers want to understand and limit their exposure to supply
    chain attacks but have no means of doing so.
*   Artifact signatures alone only prevent a subset of the attacks we care
    about.

At a minimum, SLSA can be used as a set of guiding principles for software
producers and consumers. More importantly, SLSA allows us to talk about supply
chain risks and mitigations in a common language. This allows us to communicate
and act on those risks across organizational boundaries.

Numeric levels, in particular, are useful because they are simple. A decision
maker easily understands that SLSA 3 is better than SLSA 2 without understanding
any of the details. That said, we are not committed to numeric levels and are
open to other options.

Once SLSA is complete it will provide a mapping from requirements that the
supply chain can implement to the attacks they can prevent. Software producers
and consumers will be able to look at the SLSA level of a software artifact and
know what attacks have been defended against in its production.

## How to get started

**Developers:** For instructions on how to produce and verify SLSA-compliant
software... **\[TODO]**.

**Implementers:** For detailed requirements on how source and build systems can
meet SLSA, see [spec/README.md].

## Related work

In parallel to the SLSA specification, there is work to develop core formats and
data models. Currently this is joint work between
[Binary Authorization](https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization) and
[in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) but we invite wider participation.

*   [Standard attestation format](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation#in-toto-attestations)
    to express provenance and other attributes. This will allow sources and
    builders to express properties in a standard way that can be consumed by
    anyone. Also includes reference implementations for generating these
    attestations.
*   Policy data model and reference implementation.

## Footnotes

[^1]: "Trusted person" is defined by the organization or developers that
    own/produce the software. A consumer must ultimately trust them to do the
    right thing. The non-unilateral principle protects against individuals
    within the organization subverting the organization's goals.
