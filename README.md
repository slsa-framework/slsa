SLSA (pronounced ["salsa"](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+pronounce+salsa)) is a security framework from source to service, giving anyone working with software a common language for increasing levels of software security and supply chain integrity. Itâ€™s how you get from safe enough to being as resilient as possible, at any link in the chain.
