title: Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts
description: SLSA is a security framework. It is a check-list of standards and controls to prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure in your projects, businesses or enterprises. It’s how you get from safe enough to being as resilient as possible, at any link in the chain.
subheading: Safeguarding artifact integrity across any software supply chain

                <p>Any software can introduce vulnerabilities into a supply chain. As a system gets more complex, it’s critical to already have checks and best practices in place to guarantee artifact integrity, that the source code you’re relying on is the code you’re actually using. Without solid foundations and a plan for the system as it grows, it’s difficult to focus your efforts against tomorrow’s next hack, breach or compromise.</p>

                <p>SLSA levels are like a common language to talk about how secure software, supply chains and their component parts really are. From source to platform, the levels blend together industry-recognized best practices to create four compliance levels of increasing assurance.
                These look at the builds, sources and dependencies in open source or commercial software. Starting with easy, basic steps at the lower levels to build up and protect against advanced threats later, bringing SLSA into your work means prioritized, practical measures to prevent unauthorized modifications to software, and a plan to harden that security over time.</p>

                <p>SLSA is for everyone involved in producing, consuming, and providing infrastructure for software such as build platforms and package ecosystems.
                SLSA can help create more trust across the entire supply chain. It can be used by producers for protection against tampering and insider threats, by consumers to verify the software they rely on is secure, and by infrastructure providers as a guideline for hardening build platforms and processes.<p>
