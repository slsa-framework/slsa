A software attestation is an authenticated statement (metadata) about a
software artifact or collection of software artifacts.
The primary intended use case is to feed into automated policy engines, such as
[in-toto] and [Binary Authorization].

This page provides a high-level overview of the attestation model, including
standardized terminology, data model, layers, conventions for software
attestations, and formats for different use cases.

## Overview

A **software attestation**, not to be confused with a [remote attestation] in
the trusted computing world, is an authenticated statement (metadata) about a
software artifact or collection of software artifacts. Software attestations
are a generalization of raw artifact/code signing.

With raw signing, a signature is directly over the artifact (or a hash of the
artifact) and *implies* a single bit of metadata about the artifact, based on
the public key. The exact meaning MUST be negotiated between signer and
verifier, and a new keyset MUST be provisioned for each bit of information. For
example, a signature might denote who produced an artifact, or it might denote
fitness for some purpose, or something else entirely.

With an attestation, the metadata is *explicit* and the signature only denotes
who created the attestation (authenticity). A single keyset can express an
arbitrary amount of information, including things that are not possible with
raw signing. For example, an attestation might state exactly how an artifact
was produced, including the build command that was run and all of its
dependencies (as in the case of SLSA [Provenance]).

## Formats

This section explains how to choose the attestation format that's best suited
for your situation by considering factors such as intended use and who will be
consuming the attestation.

### First party

Producers of first party code might consider the following questions:

-   Will SLSA be used only within our organization?
-   Is SLSA's primary use case to manage insider risk?
-   Are we developing entirely in a closed source environment?

If these are the main considerations, the organization can choose any format
for internal use. To make an external claim of meeting a SLSA level, however,
there needs to be a way for external users to consume and verify your provenance.
Currently, SLSA recommends using the [SLSA Provenance format] for SLSA
attestations since it is easy to verify using the [Generic SLSA Verifier].

### Open source

Producers of open source code might consider these questions:

-   Is SLSA's primary use case to convey trust in how your code was developed?
-   Do you develop software with standard open source licenses?
-   Will the code be consumed by others?

In these situations, we encourage you to use the [SLSA Provenance format]. The SLSA
Provenance format offers a path towards interoperability and cohesion across the open
source ecosystem. Users can verify any provenance statement in this format
using the [Generic SLSA Verifier].

### Closed source, third party

Producers of closed source code that is consumed by others might consider
the following questions:

-   Is my code produced for the sole purpose of specific third party consumers?
-   Is SLSA's primary use case to create trust in our organization or to comply with
audits and legal requirements?

In these situations, you might not want to make all the details of your
provenance available externally. Consider using Verification Summary
Attestations (VSAs) to summarize provenance information in a sanitized way
that's safe for external consumption. For more about VSAs, see the [Verification
Summary Attestation] page.

## Model and Terminology

We define the following model to represent any software attestations, regardless
of format. Not all formats will have all fields or all layers, but to be called
a "software attestation" it MUST fit this general model.

The key words MUST, SHOULD, and MAY are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119].

An example of an attestation in English follows with the components of the
attestation mapped to the component names (and colors from the model diagram above):

![Attestation model to English mapping](images/attestation_example_english.svg)

Components:

-   **Artifact:** Immutable blob of data described by an attestation, usually
    identified by cryptographic content hash. Examples: file content, git
    commit, container digest. MAY also include a mutable locator, such as
    a package name or URI.
-   **Attestation:** Authenticated, machine-readable metadata about one or more
    software artifacts. An attestation MUST contain at least:
    -   **Envelope:** Authenticates the message. At a minimum, it MUST contain:
        -   **Message:** Content (statement) of the attestation. The message
            type SHOULD be authenticated and unambiguous to avoid confusion
            attacks.
        -   **Signature:** Denotes the **attester** who created the attestation.
    -   **Statement:** Binds the attestation to a particular set of artifacts.
        This is a separate layer to allow for predicate-agnostic processing
        and storage/lookup. MUST contain at least:
        -   **Subject:** Identifies which artifacts the predicate applies to.
        -   **Predicate:** Metadata about the subject. The predicate type SHOULD
            be explicit to avoid misinterpretation.
    -   **Predicate:** Arbitrary metadata in a predicate-specific schema. MAY
        contain:
        -   **Link:** *(repeated)* Reference to a related artifact, such as
            build dependency. Effectively forms a [hypergraph] where the
            nodes are artifacts and the hyperedges are attestations. It is
            helpful for the link to be standardized to allow predicate-agnostic
            graph processing.
-   **Bundle:** A collection of Attestations, which are usually but not
    necessarily related.
-   **Storage/Lookup:** Convention for where attesters place attestations and
    how verifiers find attestations for a given artifact.

## Recommended Suite

We recommend a single suite of formats and conventions that work well together
and have desirable security properties. Our hope is to align the industry around
this particular suite because it makes everything easier. That said, we
recognize that other choices MAY be necessary in various cases.

| Component | Recommendation
| --- | ---
| Envelope | **[DSSE]** (ECDSA over NIST P-256 (or stronger) and SHA-256.)
| Statement | **[in-toto attestations]**
| Predicate | Choose as appropriate, i.e.; [Provenance], [SPDX], [other predicates defined by third-parties]. If none are a good fit, invent a new one
| Bundle | **[JSON Lines]**, see [attestation bundle]
| Storage/Lookup | **TBD**
