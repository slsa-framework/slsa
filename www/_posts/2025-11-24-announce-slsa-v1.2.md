Today we’re pleased to announce the release of [SLSA Version 1.2](/spec/v1.2/),
the latest version of the SLSA specification.

With the introduction of the _Source Track_, SLSA v1.2 represents a major
milestone in the development of SLSA. The Source Track covers threats from
the authoring and reviewing and management of source code. For more details on
how SLSA addresses these threats please refer to
[Threats & mitigations](/threats).

Please, refer to the [What's new](/spec/v1.2/whats-new) section for further
details.

SLSA v1.2 is backwards compatible with SLSA v1.1.

The SLSA specification follows the [Community Specification] lifecycle
going through several [stages of maturation](/spec-stages). This release is the
culmination of that process. During the development of SLSA v1.2 we received
and addressed [feedback] from the community. We'd like to thank everyone that
took the time to review the release candidates and PRs and everyone that
contributed to its development.

After today's release development of the SLSA specification
[continues](/current-activities) with the development of the Build Environment
Track and the Dependency Track. Learn how you can
[get involved](/community#get-involved) with their development.
