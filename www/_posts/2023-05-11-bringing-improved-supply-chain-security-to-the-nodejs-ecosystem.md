It has been a big month for supply chain security!
[GitHub recently announced the public beta](https://github.blog/2023-04-19-introducing-npm-package-provenance/)
for npm package provenance. This adds new functionality to npmjs.com and the npm
CLI that allows package maintainers to generate and upload SLSA Build Level 2
provenance along with their packages. Integration with
[Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) enables verification of signature and
certificate metadata so users know that the package came from the expected
source repository.

The SLSA Tooling SIG has been collaborating with GitHub to give npm package
authors more options to further harden builds. As part of this collaboration, we
are announcing the beta of the
[SLSA3 Node.js builder for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/tree/main/internal/builders/nodejs).
The Node.js builder provides a
[GitHub Actions reusable workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)
that can be called to perform the build, generate SLSA Build L3 compliant
provenance, and publish it to the npm registry along with the package.

Given that Node.js is one of the largest open source ecosystems, we believe
these announcements go a long way towards improving supply chain security for
open source overall. As packages adopt SLSA provenance, we hope that npm can
serve as a model for more open source ecosystems in the future.

## Major Steps in Securing the OSS Supply Chain

GitHub's first-class support for package provenance in npm is a major step
forward in Open Source supply chain security for a number of reasons.

First, it provides a way for package maintainers to generate provenance for
their packages with minimal changes to their development workflows. This allows
busy Open Source developers to get large supply chain security gains with only a
small time investment.

Second, it provides a natural way to host provenance along with the package
itself. This takes advantage of existing package tooling to transparently
distribute provenance to users so it can be verified easily.

Third, verification can be incorporated into the user's normal workflow via the
`npm audit signatures` command. Provenance adds the most value if it can be
verified before install. Support for verification in the npm CLI makes this much
easier.

With this new support the provenance generated by npm projects achieves
[SLSA Build Level 2](/spec/v1.0/levels#build-l2). SLSA Build L2
gives projects a huge boost to software supply chain integrity of npm packages.
It prevents tampering after the build with digital signatures, reduces the
attack surface to one that can be more easily audited and hardened, and allows
for easier migration to more hardened SLSA Build levels in the future.

## Going Further with SLSA on GitHub Actions

[SLSA Build L3](/spec/v1.0/levels#build-l3-hardened-builds)
improves upon SLSA Build L2 with additional requirements. These include further
hardening the build process by preventing build runs from influencing one
another, and preventing secret material used to sign the provenance from being
accessible to the build steps. The benefits of the new requirements include
preventing tampering during the build, and reducing the impact of compromised
registry credentials.

These advantages are important because package installs and builds can run
untrusted and potentially compromised code from dependencies and other sources.
This in turn could allow attackers to leak private keys, modify provenance or
generate provenance for other artifacts. As we have seen
[in](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pjwm-rvh2-c87w)
[the](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-73qr-pfmq-6rp8)
[past](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g2q5-5433-rhrf), open source packages
are not immune to these targeted attacks.

The Node.js builder, built in collaboration with GitHub, does this by executing
the build, generation, and signing of provenance in separate
[jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-jobs-in-a-workflow)
separated by a virtual machine (VM) security boundary provided by
[GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).

Using the Node.js builder is as easy as making a GitHub Actions
reusable workflow call. Most packages can slot this into their workflows fairly
seamlessly.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    permissions:
      id-token: write # For signing
      contents: read  # For repo checkout.
      actions: read   # For getting workflow run info.
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    uses: slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/builder_nodejs_slsa3.yml@v1.6.0
    with:
      run-scripts: "ci, build"
```

[documentation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/tree/main/internal/builders/nodejs).

## Exploring and monitoring the npm package security landscape

In addition to the direct security benefits provided by SLSA, provenance
provides more information on packages, improving their trustworthiness. The SLSA
Tooling SIG has collaborated with Google
[Open Source Insights](https://deps.dev/) (deps.dev) to support
[exploration of provenance metadata for npm packages](https://blog.deps.dev/npm-provenance/).
This new feature will support both npm package provenance and provenance
generated by the SLSA3 Node.js builder and can be used in conjunction with the
npm official registry.

Explore some packages that generate provenance today:

-   [js-cookie](https://deps.dev/npm/js-cookie)
-   [jose](https://deps.dev/npm/jose)
-   [sigstore](https://deps.dev/npm/sigstore)
-   [pacote](https://deps.dev/npm/pacote)
-   [swr](https://deps.dev/npm/swr)

## The value of cooperation

Support for SLSA provenance in the npm public registry is a great step forward
for improving the supply chain security of open-source projects. As we move
forward, improved support for supply chain security and cooperation with
programming language ecosystems is vital and we are looking forward to working
with more ecosystems in the future.

Please try out the new
[Node.js builder](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/tree/main/internal/builders/nodejs)
and let us know what you think by opening an
[issue](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/issues) on
GitHub. You can also ask a question in the
[#slsa-tooling](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C03PDLFET5W) channel in the
[OpenSSF community slack](https://slack.openssf.org/). We would love to hear
from you! You can follow along with the development of the Node.js builder's GA
release via our development
[milestone](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/milestone/17).

See you soon!
