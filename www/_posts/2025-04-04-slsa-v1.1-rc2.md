Today we’re releasing the [SLSA Version 1.1 RC2](/spec/v1.1-rc2/) for
public review. We are seeking comments on these spec changes by April
18, 2025. This release brings several changes aimed at enhancing the
clarity and usability of the original specification. It also introduces
backwards-compatible clarifications to the SLSA threat model, attestation
model and verification procedure. This includes the addition of verifier
metadata to the Verification Summary Attestation (VSA) format. Please,
refer to the [What's new](/spec/v1.1-rc2/whats-new) section for further
details.

What does this update mean for SLSA implimentors? Good news! This means
that SLSA 1.1 is backwards compatible with SLSA 1.0.

Although this is a relatively minor update, the SLSA working group has also
been busy developing several new tracks covering areas such as source and
build environment. We had originally hoped to release these 1.1
improvements as part of larger update but in the end we felt that the 1.1
release was warranted.

So what’s next? The SLSA specification follows the [Community Specification]
lifecycle going through several [stages of maturation](/spec-stages). The
publication of a candidate for [Approved Specification] starts a 2 week
review period during which the community at large is invited to review the
draft and raise any issues. If you do find any issue, please, open an issue
on [GitHub]. If no major issues are found during this review period the
V1.1 RC2 draft will then be published as Version 1.1, the new
[Approved Specification], effectively replacing Version 1.0.
